# Reading list (navigation)

- [AI Agent](./ai_agent.md)
- [Multimodal Learning](./multimodal_learning.md)

This repository's `README.md` is now a navigation hub. The reading/checklist items have been moved into their own files so each topic can grow independently.

Files:

- `ai_agent.md` — AI Agent reading list and checklist
- `multimodal_learning.md` — Multimodal Learning reading list and checklist

Contributions: add entries directly to the topic file and keep the `README.md` for top-level navigation.
